Introduction to Python Programming

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that's perfect for beginners.

Key Features:
1. Easy to read and write
2. Extensive standard library
3. Cross-platform compatibility
4. Large community support

Getting Started:
- Install Python from python.org
- Use IDLE or PyCharm as your IDE
- Start with simple print statements
- Learn about variables and data types

Basic Syntax:
print("Hello, World!")
name = "Python"
age = 30
        """,
        
        "python/beginner/variables_and_types.txt": """
Python Variables and Data Types

Variables in Python:
- No need to declare variable types
- Dynamic typing
- Case-sensitive names

Data Types:
1. Numbers: int, float, complex
2. Strings: text data
3. Booleans: True/False
4. Lists: ordered collections
5. Dictionaries: key-value pairs

Examples:
number = 42
text = "Hello Python"
is_ready = True
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
        """,

Python Functions and Classes

Functions:
- Reusable blocks of code
- Can accept parameters
- Can return values
- Support default arguments

def greet(name, message="Hello"):
    return f"{message}, {name}!"

Classes:
- Blueprint for creating objects
- Encapsulate data and methods
- Support inheritance

class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, grade):
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade
    
    def study(self, subject):
        return f"{self.name} is studying {subject}"

- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript is a programming language that runs in web browsers and servers.

Key Concepts:
1. Variables: let, const, var
2. Functions: function declarations and expressions
3. Objects: key-value pairs
4. Arrays: ordered lists
5. DOM manipulation

Basic Syntax:
let message = "Hello JavaScript";
const PI = 3.14159;

function calculateArea(radius) {
    return PI * radius * radius;
}

const user = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    email: "john@example.com"

Common Use Cases:
- Web page interactivity
- Form validation
- API communication
- Dynamic content updates

Introduction to Derivatives

A derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable.

Basic Definition:
f'(x) = lim(h‚Üí0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h

Common Derivative Rules:
1. Power Rule: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
2. Constant Rule: d/dx(c) = 0
3. Sum Rule: d/dx(f+g) = f' + g'
4. Product Rule: d/dx(fg) = f'g + fg'
5. Chain Rule: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

Examples:
- d/dx(x¬≤) = 2x
- d/dx(3x¬≥) = 9x¬≤
- d/dx(sin(x)) = cos(x)
- d/dx(e^x) = e^x

Applications:
- Finding maximum and minimum values
- Analyzing motion and velocity
- Optimization problems
- Economics and business

Programming Basics - Lesson 1

Objective: Understanding fundamental programming concepts

What is Programming?
Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to follow.

Key Concepts:
1. Algorithm: Step-by-step solution to a problem
2. Syntax: Rules of a programming language
3. Variables: Storage locations for data
4. Control Structures: if/else, loops
5. Functions: Reusable code blocks

Programming Workflow:
1. Understand the problem
2. Plan the solution
3. Write the code
4. Test and debug
5. Document your work

Best Practices:
- Write clear, readable code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment your code
- Test thoroughly
- Follow coding standards

Exercise:
Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle.

Python Practice Problems

Problem 1: Calculator
Create a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.

def calculator(num1, num2, operation):
    # Your code here
    pass

Problem 2: List Operations
Write functions to:
- Find the maximum number in a list
- Count how many times a value appears
- Remove duplicates from a list

Problem 3: String Manipulation
Create functions that:
- Reverse a string
- Check if a string is a palindrome
- Count vowels in a string

Problem 4: File Operations
Write a program that:
- Reads a text file
- Counts the number of words
- Finds the most common word

Problem 5: Class Design
Design a Library class that can:
- Add books
- Remove books
- Search for books by title or author
- Track borrowed books

Solution Guidelines:
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments to explain your logic
- Handle edge cases
- Test your functions with different inputs
